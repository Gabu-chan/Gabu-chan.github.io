  <p style="margin-right: 500px;margin-left: 500px;text-indent: 50px;font-size:125%;padding: 20px;margin-top: 100px;">My one goal is to help other people and be happy. Palm Desert High School, in Palm Desert, is the school that I am attending for four years. I have taken Computer Science Principles, and Math 1, 2, and 3 compacted. I am going to take the AP class for Computer Science. I am really interested in MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and I would like to take any computer science and any engineering degrees. The only relevant work experience that I have is fixing computers and building them. I am very good at hosting servers and anything computer related, troubleshooting, debugging, etc. I can speak and understand Portuguese very well, and I also have family in Brazil. During my free time I usually play on the computer, most of the time though I have to host a server for my friends to play with me, usually in minecraft, so I have some experience with Java. I love to experiment with my 3D printer, it uses gcode, so I also know how to do that. Lastly, I do Fencing and I go to competitions.</p>
