This is my career goal, to go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then to create the next big company to help everyone everywhere. Currently I am a 15 years old and I am from Palm Desert High School as a sophomore. I will achieve my goals by studying hard in my classes, and in my college classes. I am involved with lots of robotics and computer based projects and classes for the past 10 year, and yes, I had my first computer when I was 5, a windows xp laptop by Vivo.</p><p style="text-indent: 50px;;font-size:125%;">	I am smart when I want to be smart, hence the A's and B's every year. I really love mechanical things like watches and 3D printers. I also love computers ever since I was little. In fact people contact me to fix their computers, electronics, and anything mechanical. I am a very curious guy, if I do not get how something works, then I will always ask about it and how it works. Throughout most of the school I usually go for science oriented classes, like Computer Science, Robotics, and Physics.
</p><p style="text-indent: 50px;font-size:125%;">	     I have done several things that accomplished within the 15 years of my life. When I used to do botball, my first tournament as team captain, I got first place in seeding, second place overall, and third place in double elimination. These past experiences really important, I have learned gigantic amounts of information, from coding to building this is what I love to do. I am done talking, thank you for lending me your time and enjoy the rest of my site.
