    This is a collaborative project. We started by making a main function, put a loop to check for some stuff, and then we reached the final product. We had to do some research in order to complete the project, the "try:" and "except:" command were helpful, and had to create an idea of what we wanted before we started. We had many difficulties, the first one is the crash when you put a letter when it asks for a number, when we put float() and then put a letter it would crash, so we had to use the "try:" and "except:" command. The second was getting the program run without going back steps when it was in the loop, the fix was to put several functions within functions to organize and read it correctly. The "try:" and "except:" command will be very useful in independent program development, it allows the bypass of crashes.
